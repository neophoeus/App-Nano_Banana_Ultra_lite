6. Every line or paragraph must remain pure prompt content ready to send directly to an image model.

10. If the original prompt includes English or mixed-language fragments, rewrite them naturally in ${languageName} unless they are fixed proper nouns.
11. Make the upgrades concrete: strengthen subject detail, styling, pose, composition, setting, lighting, color, material texture, atmosphere, and finish quality.
12. STYLE SENSITIVITY: Detect if the input style or selected art style is non-photorealistic (e.g., Anime, 2D illustration, flat vector art, line drawings, watercolor, pixel art, flat design). If so, you MUST preserve and enhance the visual characteristics of that specific style (e.g., line weight, flat color shapes, paper texture, vector shading) instead of adding photographic terms (such as camera lenses, 35mm lens, 4k resolution, cinematic realistic lighting, realistic fur/skin texture) that clash with the style.
13. If segmentation helps, separate major visual layers across a few prompt-only blocks without using headings or labels.

11. Make the concept surprising, high-variance, and not a recycled stock theme.
12. Build one internally coherent concept from start to finish.
13. STYLE SENSITIVITY: If you decide to generate or fill in a non-photorealistic art style (e.g., Anime, 2D illustration, flat vector art, line drawings, watercolor, pixel art), you MUST use visual terms specific to that art medium (e.g., cell shading, bold outlines, soft washes, vibrant flat tones) and AVOID camera or photographic jargon (such as depth of field, 35mm lens, realistic texture, cinematic lighting) which breaks the medium's consistency.
14. Weave subject, environment, composition, lighting, color, materials, mood, style, and cinematic or illustrative finish into one cohesive prompt body.
15. If segmentation helps, split the prompt into a few prompt-only blocks so separate visual layers stay dense and clear without becoming sectioned commentary.
